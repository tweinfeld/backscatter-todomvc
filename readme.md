# Backscatter + Backbone + React TodoMVC

> Backscatter is a tiny [Backbone](http://backbonejs.org/) extension which assists you with keeping track of events in your entire Backbone model tree. Whenever Backscatter detects an event from a model somewhere in your tree (below a certain "root model"), it relays it to you. This makes it super useful for triggering React renders!
